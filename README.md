## Circular Progress Bar
This project demonstrates a simple animated circular progress bar built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The progress bar fills up dynamically to a pre-defined percentage and displays the progress as text inside the circular bar.

## Features:
Dynamic Progress Animation: The progress bar fills up to 65% through an animated sequence.
SVG Circle: The circular progress bar is created using an SVG element, with a smooth gradient from pink to purple.
Real-Time Percentage Display: A counter inside the progress circle updates in real-time to reflect the current progress percentage.

## How It Works:
HTML Structure: The main elements include a div for the progress container and an SVG element for the circular path. The percentage is displayed inside the inner div of the progress bar.
CSS Styling: The appearance of the progress bar is handled using a linked CSS file (not included in the provided code).
JavaScript Animation: The progress percentage is incremented by 1% every 30 milliseconds until it reaches 65%, and the number is displayed dynamically inside the circle.

## Usage:
Simply load the HTML file in a browser to see the circular progress bar in action. The animation will automatically start, updating the percentage inside the circle until it reaches 65%.
